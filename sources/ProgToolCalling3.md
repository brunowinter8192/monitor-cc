Step 5: Final response
Once the code execution completes, Claude provides the final response:

Output
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "code_execution_tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "srvtoolu_abc123",
      "content": {
        "type": "code_execution_result",
        "stdout": "Top 5 customers by revenue:\n1. Customer C1: $45,000\n2. Customer C2: $38,000\n3. Customer C5: $32,000\n4. Customer C8: $28,500\n5. Customer C3: $24,000",
        "stderr": "",
        "return_code": 0,
        "content": []
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "I've analyzed the purchase history from last quarter. Your top 5 customers generated $167,500 in total revenue, with Customer C1 leading at $45,000."
    }
  ],
  "stop_reason": "end_turn"
}
Advanced patterns
Batch processing with loops
Claude can write code that processes multiple items efficiently:

async def _claude_code():
    regions = ["West", "East", "Central", "North", "South"]
    results = {}
    for region in regions:
        data = await query_database(f"<sql for {region}>")
        results[region] = sum(row["revenue"] for row in data)

    # Process results programmatically
    top_region = max(results.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    print(f"Top region: {top_region[0]} with ${top_region[1]:,} in revenue")

This pattern:

Reduces model round-trips from N (one per region) to 1
Processes large result sets programmatically before returning to Claude
Saves tokens by only returning aggregated conclusions instead of raw data
Early termination
Claude can stop processing as soon as success criteria are met:

async def _claude_code():
    endpoints = ["us-east", "eu-west", "apac"]
    for endpoint in endpoints:
        status = await check_health(endpoint)
        if status == "healthy":
            print(f"Found healthy endpoint: {endpoint}")
            break  # Stop early, don't check remaining

Conditional tool selection
async def _claude_code():
    file_info = await get_file_info(path)
    if file_info["size"] < 10000:
        content = await read_full_file(path)
    else:
        content = await read_file_summary(path)
    print(content)

Data filtering
async def _claude_code():
    logs = await fetch_logs(server_id)
    errors = [log for log in logs if "ERROR" in log]
    print(f"Found {len(errors)} errors")
    for error in errors[-10:]:  # Only return last 10 errors
        print(error)

Response format
Programmatic tool call
When code execution calls a tool:

{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "id": "toolu_abc123",
  "name": "query_database",
  "input": { "sql": "<sql>" },
  "caller": {
    "type": "code_execution_20260120",
    "tool_id": "srvtoolu_xyz789"
  }
}
Tool result handling
Your tool result is passed back to the running code:

{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_abc123",
      "content": "[{\"customer_id\": \"C1\", \"revenue\": 45000, \"orders\": 23}, {\"customer_id\": \"C2\", \"revenue\": 38000, \"orders\": 18}, ...]"
    }
  ]
}
Code execution completion
When all tool calls are satisfied and code completes:
